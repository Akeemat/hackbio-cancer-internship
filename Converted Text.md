### **The relevance of Quinolones to AMR in Cancer**

Authors (@slack): Akeemat Ayinla (@That\_Hakeemah)

Quinolones are a significant antibiotic class, widely used for treating several infections such as gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), Gonorrhoea, prostatitis, tuberculosis, and community-acquired pneumonia (Aldred et al.,2014; Gillespie,2016). They are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and are often preferred because of their broad spectrum of activity, high potency, convenient formulations, and relatively fewer side effects (Andersson & MacGowan,2003; Pham et al.,2019).

Quinolones are bactericidal; they inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis by targeting bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are critical for bacterial DNA replication and transcription (Bates & Maxwell,2005; Bush et al.,2015). Based on their spectrum of activity, quinolones are classified into four generations: first (e.g., nalidixic acid), second (e.g., ciprofloxacin), third (e.g., sparfloxacin), and fourth (e.g., moxifloxacin) generations (Naber & Adam,1998; Pham et al.,2019). 


### **Quinolones: Catalysts for Enhanced Resistance in Cancer Patients**

The use of quinolones in cancer therapy is a double-edged sword. Although they are commonly prescribed for prophylaxis of bacterial infections in cancer patients, they contribute to the emergence and spread of bacterial resistance, like other antimicrobials (Baden et al.,2016). In cancer patients, there is an increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression resulting from hematological cancers and cytotoxic chemotherapy (Schelenz et al.,2013). This necessitates the incorporation of prophylactic antibiotics into treatment plans. Fluoroquinolones are widely recommended, but their extensive use exacerbates resistance to fluoroquinolones and other antibiotic classes (Rangaraj et al.,2010; Hamed et al.,2018).

For instance, a study that sampled specimens collected from infected cancer patients at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University detected a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance with accompanying plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants (Hamed et al.,2018). This is particularly important because PMQRs promote the emergence of mutants with higher levels of resistance (Hooper & Jacoby, 2016). Another study, a retrospective study of bacteremia in patients with central venous catheters at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, observed that fluoroquinolone-containing regimens were associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Rangaraj et al.,2010).


### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, while quinolones are effective as prophylactic antimicrobials, they have negative long-term effects on resistance. The treatment of drug-resistant pathogens is more challenging. Therefore, it is important to carefully balance the appropriate use of quinolones for prophylaxis with practical strategies to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

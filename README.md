**Introduction**

Welcome to my HackBio internship repository. Here, I provide an overview of my activities during the internship.

Hackbio is a platform which provides scientists from different backgrounds with knowledge and experience in bioinformatics. Through working on different individual and team projects, interns build bioinformatic skills including data analysis and visualization, and programming in Biology.

My specific track is **AMR in cancers** and the major tools I used are **Microsoft Excel, R and Bash.**

**Brief Overview of activities**

**Stage 0: Building Theoretical Foundations and Essay Writing**

Here, I reviewed the literature and read up on topics relevant to the concept of AMR in cancer. I wrote a short essay on “The relevance of Quinolones to AMR in Cancer”.

**Stage 1: Literature Review**

Alongside three other team members, I reviewed a paper titled “Whole-Genome Sequencing Accurately Identifies resistance to Extended-Spectrum β-Lactams for Major Gram-Negative Bacterial Pathogens” for the major purpose of understanding the core message. From this, the team produced a three-minute video highlighting the key points of the paper.

**Stage 2: Programming in Biology & Data Visualization**

Alongside four other team members, I analyzed and visualized a dataset on the activity of new antibacterials on WHO-priority pathogens using R. From this, we created an infographic summary of key results from the analysis.

**Stage 3: Pipeline Implementation**&#x20;

This stage of the internship consisted of two phases.

In Phase 1, I worked with a team member to set up a basic pipeline to analyze sequencing data.

In Phase 2, we analyzed and visualized WHO datasets on global cholera outbreak from 1949 to 2016. We identified key trends, patterns and significant outbreaks. We also developed a summary template for reporting cholera outbreak data for different countries.

After this, we teamed up with four front-end bioinformaticians and provided them with our data, figures and reports. With the aid of these, they developed an interactive dashboard to visualize the cholera outbreak data. The link can be found here: <https://goal-getters.shinyapps.io/Cholera/>
